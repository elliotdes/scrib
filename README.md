I have been trying to move away from paper notes.

I read scottshipp's series on [note-taking](https://dev.to/scottshipp/series/15100) and I really liked the idea.

This is my personal take on it which I will be able to integerate fully with the other tools I use for tracking my work (Tasks, Calendars, etc).
